This project aims to develop a 3D maps of university to the extent to add 3D models of different popular buildings on top of Google Maps.

Different technologies like svelte ( for preparing web interface ), Google Maps Vector map with WebGL hooks ( for 3D map ), ThreeJS to utilise google maps hooks to place models to 3D MAP and Blender ( for 3D models ) will be used.


Title: Developing a 3D Campus Map for Enhanced Visualization

Abstract:

The project focuses on the development of a 3D campus map to provide users with an improved visualization of our university campus. This practical endeavor combines a concise set of technologies to offer a feasible and user-friendly experience for both students and visitors.

our project aims to create a practical 3D map of our university campus. The projects primary aim is to show thats its possible to create a 3D map of our campus using simple technologies. The project will be developed using svelte, google maps, three.js and blender.

Our project utilizes straightforward and accessible technologies. We employ Svelte, a modern web framework, to create a simple and user-friendly web interface that allows users to interact with the 3D map. Svelte's lightweight nature ensures efficient navigation.

To keep the project manageable, we opt for basic 3D mapping techniques. We use Google Maps and minimal WebGL integration to add depth to the map.
In lieu of complex 3D models, we use simplified representations of key campus buildings. These models are integrated using basic Three.js functionality.

In summary, our project seeks to show solution for enhancing campus visualization. By employing accessible technologies such as Svelte, basic 3D mapping, and simplified 3D models, we aim to create a user-friendly 3D map without overcomplicating the process. While our approach may not offer the complexity of large-scale projects, it addresses the core need of helping users better understand our campus layout.
